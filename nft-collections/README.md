# NFT Collections

This project covers the creation of collections of NFTs, specifically using Metaplex's Candy Machine. We'll explore both alternatives: Token Metadata Candy Machine (v3) and Core Candy Machine (v4). The goal is to explain how each work and how you can leverage them in your applications by using Umi SDK.

The topics explored are:

- The structure of a Candy Machine.
- Creating a candy machine.
- Creating a core candy machine.
