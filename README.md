# Metaplex Series

This repository was created for the purpose of explaining how to interact with Metaplex protocols in Solana. We go from how tokens work and what's an NFT to creating collections and candy machines, finishing with a demo project that covers all the concepts learned throughout the program.

The series is divided in 5 sessions:

- Tokens and NFTs
- Collections and Candy machines
- Designing apps with Metaplex protocols
- Hands-on Part I
- Hands-on Part II
