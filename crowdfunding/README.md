# Crowdfunding Platform

This project covers the usage of Metaplex protocols to solve a real life problem: Crowdfunding. We'll explore how standalone NFTs and collections of NFTs can be used as building blocks for real systems. The application is a CLI made with Commander and Umi SDK.

The topics explored are:

- Creating an NFT-based campaign.
- Initializing the pledge's collection of a campaign.
- Deposit/Refund from a campaign.
- Withdraw funds from a campaign as the creator.
- Create and setup a candy machine of rewards.
- Claim a reward in exchange of pledge NFTs.
