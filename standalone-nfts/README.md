# Standalone NFTs

This project covers the creation of multiple types of tokens using Solana Program Library (specifically the Token Program and the Associated Token Program) in conjuction with the Metaplex Program Library (mainly Token Metadata Program and the Core NFT Program). The goal is to explain how each of them work and how you can leverage them in your applications by using Umi SDK.

The topics explored are:

- The structure of a Token.
- The Token Metadata and the Token Standards.
- Creating fungible, semi-fungible and non-fungible tokens.
- Creating Core NFTs.
